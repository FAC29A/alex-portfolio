## 1. Structure a site using semantic HTML to aid accessibility
  Accessibility was one of the main requirements. We found out that it is not always possible to keep a perfect accessibility and also the design/technology decisions, so there is always a balance to mantain.
  Perfectly accessible sites may not have all the functionality or the looks that wew stated on the design phase.

### index.html:

* `<header>`: I used this for the header section of my website.
* `<nav>`: I wrapped the navigation menu with this element.
* `<ul>` and `<li>`: These were used to create an unordered list for navigation links.
* `<main>`: I encapsulated the main content of my webpage with this.
* `<section>`: I used this multiple times to structure different content sections.
* `<h1>`, `<h2>`, and `<h3>`: I used these headings to define content hierarchy.
* `<p>`: I used this for paragraphs of text.
* `<img>`: I used this to embed images with alt attributes for accessibility.
* `<form>`: I used this to create a contact form.
* `<label>`: I associated it with form fields for labeling.
* `<button>`: I used it for buttons within forms.
* `<footer>`: I used this for the footer section of my webpage.
  
### expert.html:

* `<main>`: I encapsulated the main content of my expert page with this element.
* `<div>` and `<article>`: I used these for structuring content about experts.
* `<label>`: I associated it with form fields for labeling.
* `<input>`, `<textarea>`, and `<button>`: These were the form elements I used for user interaction.
